# Todo list of things I have on the agenda

In no particular order, but trying to put things that I think are important higher

## Features

- Finish rounding out taiko mode.
  - Counting drumrolls (should be easy)
  - Balloons - sprites and functionality
  - Pause menu
- Create in-house UI for song select
- Create in-house UI for score screen
- Parsing charts with diverge notes
- Settings menu and various settings
  - Volume settings
  - Offset
  - Songs folder
  - Graphical settings
- Resolution settings and UI scaling
- Gameplay settings (set in song select)
- Translation at least to Japanese
- Search for beatmaps
- 2-Player mode

## Code Quality

- Use color-eyre for errors and actually use its features to make error messages nicer to look at.
- Similarly, use tracing for logs and allow dumping logs to file (so users can send error reports)

## Fixes

- Display colours correctly for both SRGB and RGB
